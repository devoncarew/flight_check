# Flight Check

Flight Check is a development time tool for Flutter that lets you preview your
app across different mobile device profiles — so you'll know what it looks like
without guesswork.

We support a broad range of device profiles covering common screen sizes, device
types, and notch type and safe areas sizes.

We use binding-layer emulation, so `MediaQuery` and safe areas report what a
real device would. And Flight Check is tree-shaken out in release mode, so you
don't ship any unnecessary code.

## Getting started

Add `flight_check` as a regular dependency:

```
flutter pub add flight_check
```

In your `main.dart`, call `FlightCheck.configure()` (**before** `runApp`):

```dart
import 'package:flight_check/flight_check.dart';

void main() {
  FlightCheck.configure();

  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

Then run your app as Flutter Desktop app on macOS, Linux, or Windows; the
preview UI appears automatically. You can even leave the call in
unconditionally; Flight Check is tree-shaken out at compile time for release
builds.

- **Release / profile builds** — tree-shaken out at compile time
- **iOS / Android devices** — skipped at runtime so real-device debug sessions
  are unaffected
- **Flutter Web** — excluded via a conditional import

## Calling WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()?

If your app calls `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()`, place the call to
`FlightCheck.configure()` before the `WidgetsFlutterBinding` call.

## Known limitations

- Font hinting and sub-pixel rendering match the host display, not the emulated
  device.
- Platform plugins (maps, camera, webviews) receive spoofed `FlutterView`
  metrics but their native rendering surfaces are unaffected.
- Safe area insets are static per profile; dynamic changes such as keyboard
  appearance are not emulated.
- `MediaQuery.devicePixelRatio` reflects the derived window DPR rather than the
  device's nominal DPR; apps that branch on this value may behave differently
  than on a real device.
- `defaultTargetPlatform` is overridden to match the emulated device's platform,
  giving correct scroll physics, page transitions, and haptic feedback patterns;
  however, text-field keyboard shortcuts may not match the host keyboard when
  the host OS and emulated platform differ (e.g. Android on macOS)
- back-navigation assumptions (system back button on Android, swipe-back on iOS)
  cannot be satisfied on desktop
- Flutter Web is not supported.
